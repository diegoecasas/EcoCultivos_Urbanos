1. **What need or challenge is your solution addressing?**
   Our solution aims to address the pressing issue of malnutrition and limited access to nutritious food for low-income families, particularly in Colombia. We are targeting a challenge where 14% of Colombian children suffer from malnutrition, and families struggle to afford even a single protein-rich meal daily.

2. **Describe the solution (what are its functions, main components, and who are the main users)**
   Our solution, EcoUrban Cultivations, is a social enterprise that empowers low-income mothers to cultivate their own nutritious food within confined urban spaces. We provide IoT-enabled hydroponic shelves that allow the cultivation of microgreens, which are then sold to local businesses. This system offers an accessible way for families to improve their nutritional intake and generate income.

3. **Describe how you are using the technology(ies) you selected**
   We leverage IoT technology on our hydroponic shelves to create an intelligent growing environment for microgreens. This technology monitors and controls factors like light, water, and nutrients, ensuring optimal growth conditions for the plants.

4. **Describe the results (qualitative and quantitative) of your initial prototyping**
   Through our initial prototyping, we've witnessed a remarkable improvement in families' access to fresh, nutrient-rich food. Qualitatively, mothers have reported increased confidence in their ability to contribute to their families' well-being. Quantitatively, we have produced approximately 12 kilograms of microgreens at month, showcasing the potential impact of our solution.

5. **What are your project targets/milestones for the next 12 months?**
   In the coming year, our primary goals are to expand our reach by involving and training 30 more low-income mothers as "Urban Cultivators." We aim to install our IoT-enabled hydroponic shelves in their homes and collectively produce 72 tons of nutritious vegetables annually, thereby creating a sustainable source of income and improved nutrition for these families.

## pitch
"Hello, esteemed members of UNICEF. I'm honored to introduce you to EcoUrban Cultivations, a groundbreaking initiative that is transforming the lives of low-income families while combating malnutrition head-on. Our project addresses a critical need - 14% of Colombian children suffering from malnutrition, and low income families are struggling to provide adequate nutrition to their kids.

Our solution is simple yet powerful. We're empowering low-income mothers with the means and knoledge to cultivate nutrient-rich food within their urban living spaces. 
How? 
By providing IoT-enabled hydroponic shelves that allow the growth of microgreens. These microgreens, packed with essential nutrients, are then sold to local businesses, creating a sustainable cycle of nourishment and income.

The heart of our innovation lies in the IoT technology embedded in our hydroponic shelves. This technology creates an intelligent ecosystem for microgreens, regulating light, water, and nutrients, resulting in optimal growth conditions and premium quality produce.

Our initial prototyping has yielded incredible results. Families are gaining access to fresh and nutritious food, leading to improved health and confidence. We've produced around 2 tons of microgreens, showcasing the tangible impact of our solution.

Looking forward, our vision for the next 12 months is to expand our reach. We plan to train and involve 30 more low-income mothers as 'Urban Cultivators'. With their IoT-enabled hydroponic shelves, we aim to collectively produce a remarkable 72 tons of nutrient-packed vegetables annually.

EcoUrban Cultivations isn't just about addressing malnutrition; it's about empowering communities to take control of their nutritional and financial well-being. We believe that by supporting us, you're supporting a revolution in urban agriculture and family health. Thank you for considering us for the UNICEF funding. Together, we can make a tangible impact on the lives of those who need it the most."
